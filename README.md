## Overview:
This is a program that uses AES encryption to encrypt files, for purely educational purposes (and potentially messing with your friends, in good humour).

## To do:
* Make the malware require the player to complete *Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil* on Lunatic difficulty to decrypt their files, similar to the "Rensenware" virus.
    * Probably not possible for Unix systems, so it will probably just encrypt files on Unix
* Test the code for Windows systems

## Notes
Not my artwork used in the program.
